										<li><h5><b>Randomized Rounding using Random Walks (Jun,2014 &mdash; Jun,2015):</b><br>
													Rounding algorithms are particularly of interest since they are often used to find near-optimal
													approximate solutions of integer programs in polynomial time. Even though the conventional method (proposed by Raghvan and Thompson)
													of rounding initial feasible solution of a corresponding relaxed linear program has tight error bound in the worst case, we went beyond
													that and investigated techniques that could produce better bounds for the ‘average-case’ inputs. Our method used
													an iterative transformation of initial solution using multidimensional random walk followed by constructive Lovász
													Local Lemma and produced a much better error bound for average case inputs.

										<li><h5><b>Design of Test Simulator for Microfluidic Biochips (Jun,2011 &mdash; May,2012):</b><br>
													Microuidic biochips offer promising platform for parallel DNA analysis, automated drug
													discovery etc. It is important to ensure high reliability of biochip funcitonality for safety-
													critical applications. We proposed a new technique for functional testing of bio chips for
													customized droplet route-paths. The average completion time for the customized testing
													method was nearly 10-times faster than that of Parallel Scan and Peripheral Scan testing
													methods for In-Vitro test benches. The average number of cells traversed in customized
													testing was nearly 6-10% of the Parallel and Peripheral scanning methods.

								<h4>Course Projects</h4>
									<ul>
										<li><h5><b>Feature selection for Speaker Recognition:</b><br>
												Carried out Genetic Algorithms and PSO based feature selection using MATLAB. By using 
												approximately 1-2% of 2000 features, we achieved 5-fold cross validation accuracy up to 92%. 
												<br>
												<a href="docs/speakrec.pdf">Report</a>
											</h5>
										</li>
										<li><h5><b>User Level Thread Library:</b><br>
												Developed an user level thread package with complete functionalities. 
												The functionalities include create,delete,sleep,switch etc. A Round-Robin scheduler is also implemented.
												<br>

										</li>
										<li><h5><b>Lexical Analyzer tool:</b><br>
												The objective was to develop a lexical analyzer tool that will produce lexemes for a given input program and grammar rules. 
												<br>
												<a href="">Code</a> | <a href="">Readme</a>
											</h5>
										</li>
										<li><h5><b>Automated Document Classifier:</b><br>
												Developed a <i>Bayesian Classfier</i> that could classify 8 different type of news paper articles. It achieved up to 96% accuracy.
												<br>
												<a href="">Code</a>
											</h5>
										</li>
										<li><h5><b>Pentium-II Pipeline Simulation:</b><br>
												Added the pentium-II Out-of-Order pipeline engine to <i>Tejas</i> (a high performance simulator made by IIT Delhi students).
											</h5>
										</li>
										<li><h5><b>Natural Language Query Processor:</b><br>
												Written the query processor in Prolog. The database used was a simple student database. The processor could recognize general 
												English language queries like 'In which department does Mr. ABC study' and respond correctly.

										</li>
										<li><h5><b>SIC/XE Assembler:</b><br>
												Simplified Instructional Computer(SIC) is a hypothetical architecture that was used by Leland Beck in his book 'System Software' 
												to explain the concepts of assemblers, compilers and operating systems. SIC/XE,(the XE stands for Extra Equipment), is an extension 
												of SIC which has higher memory, greater number of registers and additional instructions. The task of the assembler was to convert 
												the nmemonics and symbolic operands to their machine codes and finally write the object program in HEX code.
